# Mini System Box
A VB.net application that I've written two years ago for practising Visual Basic .NET skills. I've found its VS project on my computer today and decided to publish its source code here, you may have better ideas of using it :)
Application is written in Polish. If you'd like, I can make more functions for it ;)

## What does it do?
This app has built-in simple modules:
* **Internet browser**
* **Calendar** with possibility to open internet calendar (kalbi.pl)
* **Radio** which opens radiomap.pl website with embedded radio channels
* **Basic calculator**
* **Timer**
* **Notepad** - at this moment without formatting text.

## How to enter application?
* *SLN file* is file to open code in Visual Studio. Application is done in Visual Studio 2017 and uses .NET Framework 4.
* At *MiniSystemBox* directory is put entire source code.
