# Mini System Box
A VB.net application that I've written two years ago for practising Visual Basic .NET skills. I've found its VS project on my computer today and decided to publish its source code here, you may have better ideas of using it :)
Application is written in Polish. If you'd like, I can make more functions for it ;)

## What does it do?
This app has built-in simple modules:
* **Internet browser**
* **Calendar** with possibility to open internet calendar (kalbi.pl)
* **Radio** which opens radiomap.pl website with embedded radio channels
* **Basic calculator**
* **Timer**
* **Notepad** - at this moment without formatting text.

## How to enter application?
If you want to use it with Visual Studio:
* Download repo
* At directory where project will be put *MiniSystemBox.sln* file and create directory *MiniSystemBox*.
* Move all source code to *MiniSystemBox* directory.

## Minimal and recommended system requirements
* Any Windows with .NET Framework 4 running
  * **Recommended** Windows 7, 8.1 or 10
* 256 MB RAM and 24 MB of disk space.
  * **Recommended** more disk space for future using.
* **Recommended** connection to the Internet.
